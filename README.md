A project to develop a concept for the office of the future that promotes a healthy 
work life and lifestyle, and contributes to sustainable development [SOFCO webpage](https://sites.mdu.se/sofco)


## Assigning a proxy variable for office worker 
R-file **Assigning_office_worker_proxy.R** in Program folder contains code 
for assigning a proxy for office workers based on open-ended responses regarding 
occupation in Swedish questionnaires. This relies on the Swedish Standard 
Classification of Occupations 2012 (SSYK12). The data for SSYK12 is available on 
[Zenedo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/13848204). The R-code can be used to assign 
a proxy for office workers based on open-ended responses regarding occupation in 
other languages, provided that an occupation classification in that language is available.
